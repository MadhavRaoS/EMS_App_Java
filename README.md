# Employee Management System

## Abstract

Human resource challenges affect businesses of all sizes. Every organization has unique staff management needs, and this system provides customized employee management solutions. The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is designed to help businesses manage human resources effectively, supporting strategic planning and long-term objectives by managing employee data efficiently.

## Introduction

In the era of increasing digitization, managing vast amounts of employee data has become essential. The **EMS** was developed to replace the previous manual system and to simplify the process of managing employee records. With a user-friendly interface, the system eliminates data entry errors and enables administrators to add, view, remove, and update employee records easily.

### Key Features:
- Add, view, update, and remove employee records
- User-friendly interface with error validation for incorrect data
- Simplified employee management for administrators

### Objective:
- Develop an HR management system to facilitate the handling of employee data
- Store employee data in a structured database
- Provide a simple interface for interaction with the system

## Methodology

### Technologies Used:
- **SQL**: For managing employee data in a relational database.
- **Java**: The programming language used to build the application.
- **Swing**: Java GUI toolkit for building the graphical user interface (GUI).

### Steps Taken:
1. Explored concepts of Java Swing and applets.
2. Refined understanding by referring to various sources, including books, journals, and online resources.

## Feasibility Study

### 1. Technical Feasibility
The availability of required hardware and software was ensured, along with the necessary technical expertise to develop the system.

### 2. Operational Feasibility
Evaluating user readiness and management support for the new system to ensure smooth adoption and usage.

### 3. Economic Feasibility
Assessing whether the benefits of automating HR tasks justify the investment in developing the system.

## Implementation and Results

### Key Screens and Features:

## Testing

### Test Cases:

| Test ID | Test Purpose                        | Test Condition                                                      | Expected Output                                | Remarks             |
|---------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| TC1     | Check Username & Password           | Incorrect credentials should trigger an error message.              | Access granted to the main dashboard.         | Test successful     |
| TC2     | Add New User                        | If user already exists, show an error message.                       | New user added successfully.                  | Test successful     |
| TC3     | View Existing Employee Information  | If the employee exists, display their information.                  | Employee information displayed.               | Test successful     |
| TC4     | Remove Employee                     | If employee exists, they should be removed.                         | Employee removed successfully.                | Test successful     |
