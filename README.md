Abstract
Human resource challenges affect businesses of all sizes. Every organization has unique staff management needs, and this system provides customized employee management solutions. The Employee Management System (EMS) is designed to help businesses manage human resources effectively, supporting strategic planning and long-term objectives by managing employee data efficiently.

Introduction
In the era of increasing digitization, managing vast amounts of employee data has become essential. The EMS was developed to replace the previous manual system and to simplify the process of managing employee records. With a user-friendly interface, the system eliminates data entry errors and enables administrators to add, view, remove, and update employee records easily.

Key Features:
Add, view, update, and remove employee records
User-friendly interface with error validation for incorrect data
Simplified employee management for administrators
Objective:
Develop an HR management system to facilitate the handling of employee data.
Store employee data in a structured database.
Provide a simple interface for interaction with the system.
Methodology
Technologies Used:
SQL: For managing employee data in a relational database.
Java: The programming language used to build the application.
Swing: Java GUI toolkit for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
Steps Taken:
Explored concepts of Java Swing and applets.
Refined understanding by referring to various sources, including books, journals, and online resources.
Feasibility Study
1. Technical Feasibility
The availability of required hardware and software was ensured, along with necessary technical expertise to develop the system.

2. Operational Feasibility
Evaluating user readiness and management support for the new system to ensure smooth adoption and usage.

3. Economic Feasibility
Assessing whether the benefits of automating HR tasks justify the investment in developing the system.
